# There are several improvements that can be considered:

* An /api prefix can be added to the endpoint. It is helpful for security and routing purposes
* The next segment after /api that can be added is /V[version number], which is the API contract versioning segment
* Another specific endpoint can be considered like /rate/batch for batch requests if needed
* Unique Charging Station Identifier is an essential aspect of any charging process. This data should be included as a
  data element of request
* Unique Customer/eVehicle Identification can be included as a data element of request that can be used in the
  Authentication / Authorization process
* A global or company-wide unique request number like a UUID must be provided by the client for the purpose of tracking
  requests and troubleshooting (for instance, searching in logs or databases).
* For the presentation purpose and financial affairs like card-based payment systems like rate conversion in a
  multi-currency environment, currency detail, and locale detail can be included in the request body. It can be in a
  standard currency coding like [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
  or [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) and [ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166) for country
  and language coding which is currently well- supported in programming languages like Java
* Because financial information is included, the content encoding and verification fields, such as the payload checksum,
  are required to ensure that the data sent by the sender has not changed due to, for example, encoding changes.
* The CDR object can be composed of an array of CDR objects since, for instance, the charging process can be interrupted
  more than once. It is possible to assign a unique sequence number to every CDR object in an array for easy and
  accurate tracking.
* Based on the previous point, there could also be an array of "components" in the response object that include the
  details of each segment billing.
* Additional details about the charging station can be added to the header of each request. for e.g “Unique Charging
  station Id”, geolocation data (Latitude and Longitude), firmware details like firmware version number, or some kind of
  industry-standard spec that the charging station might be compliant with. It helps to have better control over request
  routing and filtering requests like load balancing or dropping requests.
* Returned values as the response of /rate API also missing units that can lead to ambiguity. For instance, the “time”
  property of “components'” object missing unit notation (e.g hour) or price-related properties of response object like
  “overall”, ”energy” and “transaction” currency should be specified explicitly at least at the response level for all
  prices
* Another part of in the assignment that I received is needs of clarification on HTTP response coding. Which HTTP
  response codes and under what circumstances should be returned
